Burp Suit is a graphical tool for web app security. It can do a host of things but in the free version its limited. In hack the box you will mostly use it to proxy web request and edit them before you send it off to the server. theres repeater which is basically like saving the web request allows you to repeat the web request.
PROXY : Will set the ip address and port which burp will intercept the traffic.</description>

      <description>So, Recently had to reinstall kali. I had to setup burp again to work with TLS certs. To properly intercept https traffic.
Well, just go to  http:/burp:port, click on  CA Certificate download the cert. Now, in firefox click on options click on preferences. Go to  Privacy &amp;amp; Security  take the scroll bar go all the way to the bottom and go to  View Certificares Under Certificates header.</description>
