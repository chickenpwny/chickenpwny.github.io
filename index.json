	"content": "Local file inclusion this vulnerability occurs when system commands or unsanitized user input or written into how the web server handles user input. Basically, you escape out of the current string and your commands get executed. This only grants you the access the web app has. So if the PHP script has permissions for www-data which is a web server user. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access anything with elevated permissions. Before you start thinking PHP is the bad guy I want to go ahead and say all of the webpage languages are vulnerable.\nWord list for lfi can be found in seclist: /Seclist/Fuzzing/LFI-JHADDIX.txt\n\u0026hellip;.//\u0026hellip;.//\u0026hellip;.//etc/passwd\n/../../etc/passwd\n/..../..../..../..../..../..../etc/passwd\n/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/etc/passwd\n\\…..\\\\…..\\\\…..\\\\etc\\passwd\n Often there will be filters in place, and then the job becomes understanding how the information is being filtered. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to see how PHP script in waldo handled user input read the WALDO write-up. You can also use burp to test for LFI I would recommend it makes it really convenient to test. in POISON there weren\u0026rsquo;t any filters in place so the standard escaped worked. (examples later) The web form allowed you to read local files. RCE :\nSadly LFI can\u0026rsquo;t upload files so if you want to get a reverse shell you will need the ability to upload binaries. FTP, Upload forums, you can execute the file by going to uploaded binary to execute it to get access.\n "

SMB normally isn\u0026rsquo;t connected to the internet, so it is doubtful the exploit is intended to be the initial infection. It is was an excellent tool to move around a network laterally as SMB is used legitimately by Windows for domain management. Today, it remains a way to gain SYSTEM access to unpatched system and attempt to find loot that is helpful.\nEternalBlue exploits three bugs to achieve RCE\n Wrong Casting Bug \u0026ndash; this leads to a buffer overflow Wrong Parsing Function Bug \u0026ndash; Using two functions, to trick the system they can\u0026rsquo;t handle large packs so it will split packets into smaller packers.

	"content": " POWERSHELL Overview, how to install Hugo and how to set up the web pages using GitHub as repository in a WINDOWS environment. Since most of the commands have a Linux counterpart you could follow.\nFirst off id like to say I wish there was a way to do this with less command line. I initially tried setting it up on GITLAB but I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the material I need to do within windows.\nSetting up GitHub Create two repositories the first will be named YourSite(blog whatever you want). the second must be named the desired url I.E chickenpwny.github.io / YourSite.github.io\ngit clone https://github.com/YourSite.git\nInstalling GoLang in windows Windows GoLang  AFTER INSTALLING GOLANG need to setup Hogo the Content Management System CMS. To do this we will need a windows package manger I chose Scoop.\nIF IT HANGS JUST WAIT PANIENTLY FOR ATLEAST ONE MINUTE. mkdir c:\\Hugo\\bin cd c:\\Hugo\\bin Invoke-webRequest -Uri https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.52/hugo_extended_0.52_Windows-64bit.zip -OutFile hugo_extended_0.52_Windows-64bit.zip Expand-Archive -Path .\\hugo_extended_0.52_Windows-64bit.zip -DestinationPath . scoop install unzip cd c:\\Hugo mkdir .\\sites cd .\\sites Now download \u0026amp; install scoop IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh') scoop install hugo hugo new site YourSite cd .\\yourSite cd .\\themes git submodule add https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock.git themes\\hugo-theme-docdock Now we need to set some permission for the repository. If you skip this you may get errors uploading to the repo. submodule add https://github.com/YourSiteCHANGEME/YourSiteCHANGEME.github.io.git public \u0026ndash;  Note, the period before the backslash represents current directory same as in Linux.\nCovering some commands Before we move on from here\nCreate some new content: hugo new content\\first-post.md  To host your webpage locally : hugo server -D localhost  In the content directory adding the _index.md to a folder will make it a page on the site. You can add conent in the _index.md or just use it to name the directory. A little confusing just play around.\nLets say your done editing your content and you want publish your site.\nYou can use type Hugo to generate your site you must be in the root directory of YourSite. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend using the -t switch for theme. You dont need to supply the full path.\n hugo -t YourThemeName cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; git push origin master  I had gotten confused initially and tried to upload the theme generator and thought it would generate the site on GitHub. Git hub needs index.html page, so eventually figured out that you generated the content locally then upload it. GitLab generates the content from the generator continuous deployment deal. Ithink GitHub offers it was well different guide.\n"

	"content": "PHP Type Juggling\nThis article will cover PHP type juggling, and some different ways i have encountered it on hackthebox .\nPHP has two comparisons; loose (==, =!) and strict (=\\==). Strict comparison 1 = 1, but in loose 1 could mean many things 1 could equal true or 1. Meaning that there multiple meaning for the values used. This is a built in feature for PHP to force type conversion into specific data type.\nPHP loose comparison does this to accommodate different data types for example; ‘9’ is different from 9. Adding the two data types in PHP will result in 18. In other languages like python will not accommodate such errors. PHP does this so the program might run as it was expected to. Accommodating human errors. Below are some examples of loose comparison.\n'0e1234' == '0e4321' '0e1234' == '0' '0e1234' \u0026lt;= '1' '0xf' == '15' #0xf in hexadecimal notation is 15  when php compares a string to a interger it has some weird quirks.\n'000...000' == int(0) '0e0...000' == int(0) '1e0...000' == int(1) 'abc...000' == int(0) # if a string starts with a non numerical character it will default to int(0)  Another example is when PHP try’s to interpreter a string and its converted into PHP exponential notation 0e⁰²³⁴²⁶²³⁴²²⁴¹²⁵¹⁶⁷⁸⁹ 0e²³⁴²⁶²³⁴²²⁴¹²⁵¹⁶⁷⁸⁹ equates to int(0) as well. If the number after the first letter is 0 it will remove the leading zero.\nIn the above examples the entire string is converted into a numerical value, or something completely different. Confusing I know but here are some popular charts that show how loose comparison works.\nThe Encounters\nphpsession, cookies, \u0026amp; passwords are susceptible to PHP type juggling. Allowing the attacker to take advantage of a PHP feature to gain access to valid user accounts. From what I have read, the attacker randomly generates cookies. Trying to predict the next cookie. The more random(entropy) the targets cookies have, the harder it is to preform this attack.\nIn the below example, PHP will convert both of the md5 hashes into integers. It will then compare the two values based on the integer. Even though the two hash are different they are both treated as value.\nsubmited cookie aa6fw…34tj4343 = 0 stored cookie ff6dj..w221.5885m = 0  This is also applicable to PHP authentication\nstored password e0rj238r submited password e0mfwewl  References:\nhttps://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2014/12/18/php-weak-typing-woes-with-some-pontification-about-code-and-pen-testing https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/06/23/htb-falafel.html#php-type-juggling-intro https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6b/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf https://hydrasky.com/network-security/php-string-comparison-vulnerabilities/ https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/  "

Lots of rabbit holes \u0026amp; some useless tools.\nssh monitor@waldo -i .monitor -t \u0026quot;bash --noprofile\u0026quot;  PERMISSIONS\n-rwSr--r-- 1 root root first s is the suid bit the capital S denotes the file isn't executable. -rwsr-sr-x 1 root root first s is the suid bit second is the guid bit sticky bit the file gets its permissions from the parent directory  The for mentioned permissions are system-wide can have unintended effects that can often lead to getting root access in one way or another. If the binaries only need to read files with root permissions. Theirs this thing called capabilities. where the file is given limited permission as root. There is a whole a lot of different ones to choose from the one we’re interested in is.\n/usr/bin/tac = cap_dac_read_search  Allows the binary to read files as root. It took a while to find the tools full path getcap basically the find command for Linux capabilities.\n/sbin/getcap -r / 2\u0026gt;/dev/null. If you don’t run it with dev/null it’ll kind of lead you to the .monitor script but we want tac. tac just cat but in reverse lol. cat /root/root.txt  Conclusion\nInstead of giving binaries system-wide permissions, give them the permissions they need to do the job.\n"
