	"content": "Local file inclusion is pretty rare as it requires bad coding but it does happen. This vulnerability occurs when system commands or unsanitized user input or written into how the web server handles user input. Basically, you escape out of the current string and your commands get executed. This only grants you the access the web app has. So if the PHP script has permissions for www-data which is a web server user. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access anything with elevated permissions. Before you start thinking PHP is the bad guy I want to go ahead and say all of the webpage languages are vulnerable.\nWord list for lfi can be found in seclist: /Seclist/Fuzzing/LFI-JHADDIX.txt\n\u0026hellip;.//\u0026hellip;.//\u0026hellip;.//etc/passwd\n/../../etc/passwd\n/..../..../..../..../..../..../etc/passwd\n/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/\u0026hellip;/etc/passwd\n\\…..\\\\…..\\\\…..\\\\etc\\passwd\n Often there will be filters in place, and then the job becomes understanding how the information is being filtered. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to see how PHP script in waldo handled user input read the WALDO write-up. You can also use burp to test for LFI I would recommend it makes it really convenient to test. in POISON there weren\u0026rsquo;t any filters in place so the standard escaped worked. (examples later) The web form allowed you to read local files, but once you escaped out of the directory supplying more data than the script can handle. You could read more. "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "PHP Type Juggling\nThis article will cover PHP type juggling, and some different ways i have encountered it on hackthebox .\nPHP has two comparisons; loose (==, =!) and strict (===). Strict comparison 1 = 1, but in loose 1 could mean many things 1 could equal true or 1. Meaning that there multiple meaning for the values used. This is a built in feature for PHP to force type conversion into specific data type.\nPHP loose comparison does this to accommodate different data types for example; ‘9’ is different from 9. Adding the two data types in PHP will result in 18. In other languages like python will not accommodate such errors. PHP does this so the program might run as it was expected to. Accommodating human errors. Below are some examples of loose comparison.\n'0e1234' == '0e4321' '0e1234' == '0' '0e1234' \u0026lt;= '1' '0xf' == '15' #0xf in hexadecimal notation is 15  when php compares a string to a interger it has some weird quirks.\n'000...000' == int(0) '0e0...000' == int(0) '1e0...000' == int(1) 'abc...000' == int(0) # if a string starts with a non numerical character it will default to int(0)  Another example is when PHP try’s to interpreter a string and its converted into PHP exponential notation 0e⁰²³⁴²⁶²³⁴²²⁴¹²⁵¹⁶⁷⁸⁹ 0e²³⁴²⁶²³⁴²²⁴¹²⁵¹⁶⁷⁸⁹ equates to int(0) as well. If the number after the first letter is 0 it will remove the leading zero.\nIn the above examples the entire string is converted into a numerical value, or something completely different. Confusing I know but here are some popular charts that show how loose comparison works.\nThe Encounters\nphpsession, cookies, \u0026amp; passwords are susceptible to PHP type juggling. Allowing the attacker to take advantage of a PHP feature to gain access to valid user accounts. From what I have read, the attacker randomly generates cookies. Trying to predict the next cookie. The more random(entropy) the targets cookies have, the harder it is to preform this attack.\nIn the below example, PHP will convert both of the md5 hashes into integers. It will then compare the two values based on the integer. Even though the two hash are different they are both treated as value.\nsubmited cookie aa6fw…34tj4343 = 0 stored cookie ff6dj..w221.5885m = 0  This is also applicable to PHP authentication\nstored password e0rj238r submited password e0mfwewl  References:\nhttps://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2014/12/18/php-weak-typing-woes-with-some-pontification-about-code-and-pen-testing https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/06/23/htb-falafel.html#php-type-juggling-intro https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6b/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf https://hydrasky.com/network-security/php-string-comparison-vulnerabilities/ https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/  "
