Bastion, is a windows machine that has smb, ssh, winrm. We'll find a backup a virtual box back up image a VHD file. Well get our Credentials to login from dumping NTLM-hashes from <mark>Sam, System</mark>. To get root we'll exploit some saved credentials in a configuration file to ssh into. 

**NMAP**

**SSH** Nothing here to exploit

**SMB** Guest login is enabled, this is our first way into bastion. Ill Show a couple of ways to use different tools to enumerate SMB shares.

```
smbmap -u guest -H 10.10.10.134 -r /
-u username
-r recursive
```

![smb-map](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/smb-map.png)

```
smbclient //10.10.10.134/Backups
```

![smb-client](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/smb-client.png)

**CLUES** So we found a clue in notes.txt 

```
Sysadmins: please don't transfer the entire backup file locally, the VPN to the subsidiary office is too slow.
```

â€‹	There's back-image's in the SMB share,there a few directories in. 

```
cd "/WindowsImageBackup/L4mpje-PC/Backup 2019-02-22 124351/"
```

![smb-backup-imaget](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/smb-backup-imaget.png)

We could Download the backup image which will take forever. We can mount the share to <mark> mnt </mark> and inspect the image that way. 

<img src="https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/thinking.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">

```
mount -o user=guest '//10.10.10.134/Backups' /mnt/bast-vhd 
```

![mount-smb](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/mount-smb.png)

  Well, need a Tool to mount the image so we can inspect it. I used <mark>guestmount</mark>. 

```
apt-get install libguestfs-tools
```

  After thats done with could take awhile, well mount the drive and examine it. Make a directory in mount or mnt directory. 

```
mkdir /mnt/bast-vhd
cd "/mnt/bast-vhd/WindowsImageBackup/L4mpje-PC/Backup 2019-02-22 124351/"
```

  You may have to use the full path. After some testing well find that <mark>9b9cfbc4</mark>	is our desired image.

```
mkdir /mnt/bast-vhd2
guestmount --add 9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd --inspector --ro /mnt/bast-vhd2/
```

   Windows stores user Credentials in <mark> SAM & SYSTEM</mark>, it stores them as NTLM hashes. Hashes are cryptographically secure. They only work on way, but that doesn't mean they aren't without faults.  We will be using some pwdrump which is should be reinstalled on kali. 

```
cd /mnt/bast-vhd2/Windows/System32/config
```

![ntlm-system-sam](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/ntlm-system-sam.png)

  As mentioned above will be using <mark>PWDump</mark> which will extract the <mark>NTLM</mark> hashes from <mark>SYSTEM</mark> hive and <mark>SAM</mark> hive

```
pwdump SYSTEM SAM
```

![ntlm-hashes](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/ntlm-hashes.png)

  Before running off to <mark>HASHCAT</mark> lets try <mark>crackstation.net</mark>, hashcat should be a last resort just to save time. I tried to use hashcat but didn't get anything, i also cut it short but whatever. 

  I would like to take a moment to disgust what a ntlm hash is. Colon's are a delimiter,the first part is the user-name, the next the groupid the user belongs to. notice in the image above the different users have differing id's. Ntlm hashes can store a large password up to 128 characters. they broken into two hashes. 

![ntlm-hashes2](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/ntlm-hashes2.png)

![crackstation](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/crackstation.png)

**PASSWORD** IS bureaulampje

```
user:	L4mpje
pass:	bureaulampje
```

**SHELL** We could ssh or probably winrm. 

```
ssh L4mpje@10.10.10.134
```

![user](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/user.png)

One place to check but is often forgotten about is program files and check both versions. 

![mRemoteNH](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/mRemoteNH.png)

**[mRemoteNG](https://www.reddit.com/r/mRemoteNG/comments/66hzoe/mremoteng_password_storage_is_insecure/)** Use to store passwords in clear text, now the credentials are encrypted. 

 We will have to move the files over to our lhost 

go to file > Open connectionFile

![remote2](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/remote2.PNG)

now well add this weird external terminal tool feature to extract the passwords. 

Tools > External Tools

you will notice i already have one done but i added quotes and that tripped me up thought it was apart of the password lol. then i check L4mpje and saw the same quote. this will opena  terminal with the password decrypted yes!!

```
display name :	PassWordLookUp
filename :	cmd
arguements :	/k echo %password%
```

![remote3](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/remote3.PNG)

right click on DC > external tool >passwordlookup . it should open a cmd prompt. 

![root](https://chickenpwny.github.io/images/bastion/root.PNG)

login into ssh with adminsitrator and the password done.
